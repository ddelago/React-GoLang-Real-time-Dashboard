dcapp allows the user to over-ride any constants defined within the XML spec files by using command-line arguments.
This is a very useful capability that makes customizing a run very simple.  For example, if a dcapp spec file uses the
constants WindowWidth and WindowHeight to specify window geometry and those values are set to 640 and 480 in the spec
files respectively, but the user wants to run dcapp in a 600x800 window, the user can override those default values via
the command line as follows:

    dcapp mmsev.xml WindowWidth=600 WindowHeight=800

Below is a listing of some of the constants defined within the NExSyS dcapp spec files that may be changed to suit the
user's needs for a given run.  It lists the name of the constant, the default value, and some explanatory notes and
alternate values where appropriate.

TRICK/EDGE COMM SETTINGS:
TrickHost       "localhost"    Set to "rvr1mgr" for beta dome MMSEV, or any other host as needed
EdgeDisp        "MAIN"         Tells EDGE which view to use for remote commanding.  Typically set to "BOTTOM" for a 3-
                               view EDGE display
EdgePort        "5451"         Tells EDGE which port to use for remote commanding.  Typically set to "5452" when running
                               both an EDGE manager and the EDGE client on the same machine.

HAND CONTROLLER SETTINGS:
HcActive        "0" or "1"     Tells dcapp whether or not this instance of dcapp should be tied to a set of hand
                               controller inputs
SideSpec        "port"         Tells which side's hand controllers are tied to this instance of dcapp ("port" and
                               "starboard" are the only options)

FullScreen      "False"        Set to "True" for running full-screen, typically in cockpit mockups
WindowLayout    "nexsys"       "nexsys" is the standard 28-button, landscape layout.  Set to "uei" for use in the 36-
                               button, portrait layout of the SES Orion cockpits
WindowXPos      "0"            Screen coordinates of window top-left corner
WindowYPos      "20"           Screen coordinates of window top-left corner
WindowWidth     "640"          Window size, typically "600" for uei orientation
WindowHeight    "480"          Window size, typically "800" for uei orientation

CAN BUS SETTINGS:
CanBusActive    "0"            Set to "1" when running dcapp with a CAN bus for bezel input
CanNetwork      "0"            RATS uses "1" for port and "0" for starboard
CanButtonId     "0"            RATS uses "1538"

UEI SETTINGS:
UeiActive       "0"            Set to "1" when running dcapp with a UEI for bezel input (SES Orion cockpits)
UeiHost         ""             Set to "oucmuei" for SES mini dome or "orcbuei" for SES beta dome
UeiPort         "0"            Typically set to "12" for either SES dome
UeiID           "0"            Set to "0" for left display, "1" for middle display, or "2" for right display
